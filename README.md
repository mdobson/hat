####Inspration
Hypermedia Adventure Text is a simple experiment in designing a basic
hypermedia type. With types out there for specifically designing mazes
I thought it would be cool to design a type for old school text adventure
games ala [Zork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork). The type itself is a
subset of [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren). This is because
there is already tooling and a community present around that type. The
eventual goal of this type is to be able to represent a text game like
Zork through an HTTP API.
